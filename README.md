# BiasOptimizer

This repository consists of two Jupyter notebooks focused on fault detection and classification using machine learning techniques. The project employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Decision Tree Classifier for classification tasks.

## Project Structure

- **00.ipynb**: 
  - Initial data exploration and preprocessing.
  - Application of PCA to reduce dimensionality while preserving important features.
  - Visualization of data distributions post-PCA.

- **01.ipynb**:
  - Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier for fault detection.
  - Training and evaluation of the model.
  - Detailed performance metrics including confusion matrix and classification report.

## Features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - Use of PCA to enhance computational efficiency and improve model performance.
- **Fault Classification**:
  - Decision Tree Classifier for binary or multi-class classification of fault types.
- **Visualization**:
  - Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better interpretability.
